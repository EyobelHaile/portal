    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>

    <p>I'm Bella Haile, born and raised in Asmara, Eritrea. Currently, I am a student at Year Up pursuing software
      development and support track. At an early age, I developed a passion for engineering and technology and loved
      problem solving in creative ways.</p>
    <P>Last summer, I had an opportunity interning as a design assurance engineer at a medical device manufacturing
      company where I was able to use my critical thinking and problem-solving skills to implement product design
      changes, identify quality issues, and maintain documentation.</P>

    <p>After this experience, I decided to continue working in quality as a software engineer and therefore joined the
      Year Up program to help me get there. Additionally, I have experience working with electrical equipment such as
      transformers, multimeter and resistors to design circuits and products. Currently, I am learning python, HTML,
      JavaScript, and CSS to expand my knowledge of coding and software.</P>

    <p>My main goal right now is to improve my coding skills so that I can get an entry way into the tech industry to
      gain experiences and further my career.
      Lastly, I am an empathetic and effective leader who is always willing to lend a helping hand when needed.</p>
